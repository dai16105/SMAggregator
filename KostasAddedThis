This is empty
I love wasting your time 
because you openned a file which is empty
but just because I am a good person i will share with you
one of the greatest poems I have ever written and it is because of me.

I was a steaming liquid
I was a torched straw
I was a burned wood
I was a melted steel

But now I am a misty pool
But now I am a blossomed ivy
But now I am a chalky oak
But now I am a solid building

What I was, it doesn't bother 
but what I am, it bother does

I dont forget that I was small
but I do forget how big I am
